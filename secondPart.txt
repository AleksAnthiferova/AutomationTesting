Daydreaming of my funeral
Like who would show, bet no one would go
Hey dad, would you show up for me now?
Just to bury your little boy in the ground
You broke my heart when you left me
Was just waiting
Was just waiting
I pop these pills to waste some time
As I'm faded
As I'm faded
This shit messes with my head
The only home I know is my bed
Too lazy for a suicide
I just watch the days pass hoping to die
So sick and tired of being alone
So long, farewell, I'm on my own
I'm sorry mom, I've got to go
I dug this grave I call my home
So sick and tired of being alone
So long, farewell, I'm on my own
I'm sorry mom, I've got to go
I dug this grave I call my home
I dug this grave I call my home
I dug this grave!
