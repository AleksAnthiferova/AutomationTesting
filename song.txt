So sick and tired of being alone
So long, farewell, I'm on my own
I'm sorry mom, I've got to go
I dug this grave I call my home
My life don't mean that much to me
So I'm living for you
Yeah, I'm living for you
And you can't stand the sight of me
So what's the point of this
Fucked up catastrophe?
I'm waiting for my time to start
As I waste it
As I waste it
I pop the pills to waste some time
As I'm faded
As I'm faded
This shit messes with my head
The only home I know is my bed
Too lazy for suicide
I just watch the days pass hoping to die
So sick and tired of being alone
So long, farewell, I'm on my own
I'm sorry mom, I've got to go
I dug this grave I call my home
So sick and tired of being alone
So long, farewell, I'm on my own
I'm sorry mom, I've got to go
I dug this grave I call my home
